PROLOGUE
7 months ago...
War broke out on Tilani Prime when the emperor was assassinated by an unknown assailant.  The planet was
then divided into 2 factions, one of which was led by a Tilani warlord, Jacoo.  An Alliance ship was sent
to covertly investigate the emperor's assassination, in hopes to end the war before its influence spreads across the
sector.  Jacoo seized the vessel on its course to Tilani Prime and captured all the crew members, except the captain.
The captain managed to escape on a cargo ship and flee back to Alliance space to devise a plan to rescue the
crew from execution.

7 months later...
The captain was able to convince the Alliance to allocate the resources to plan a rescue
mission.  Your journey begins here...
