Collect Reminum-66
The latest Alliance Science Division report of the nearest asteroid field shows that there are rare Reminum-66 deposits
located in some asteroids' cores.  The magnetic fields that the large asteroids produce make it difficult
to detect which asteroids contain Reminum-66.  Enter a sequence of directions (up, down, left, and right) to recalibrate
your ship's magnetic coils to detect the substance.
